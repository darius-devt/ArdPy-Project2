# ArdPy-Project2

## ðŸ§© Description

**ArdPy-Project2** is a Python-based application designed to control and interact with physical components connected to an Arduino board.  
The main goal is to provide a simple and intuitive graphical interface for users to monitor and manage hardware components such as LEDs, sensors or actuators without having to deal with complex code.

The interface displays relevant information in real-time, making it easy to understand the systemâ€™s behavior at a glance.  
The user experience is designed to be as seamless as possible, reducing the steps needed to access.

## ðŸ•˜ Initial Version

### ðŸ“Œ ArdPy_1.0

The project originally began with a preliminary setup hosted in a separate repository, which can be found at:  
ðŸ”— [https://github.com/monicodes-hub/ArdPy_1.0](https://github.com/monicodes-hub/ArdPy_1.0)

That repository includes the **initial version `v1.1.0`**, where the first Arduinoâ€“Python tests and configurations were implemented.
